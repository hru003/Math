
- Sampling is a subset of population representing the population
- Allows us to test hypothesis about characteristics of the population
- <span style="color:#ffff00">Example -</span> a student survey of 100 is a representative of the university
- Statistical Inference - inductive inference
- <span style="color:#ffff00">Example -</span> bulb life from a sample.
- Sampling Error - error in inductive inference from sample to population
- Data Collection Error due to bias

<span style="color:#00b050">Advantages of Sampling</span>

- Save time
- avoids monotony and eliminates repeated inquiries
- surveys are feasible

<span style="color:#00b050">Limitations of Sampling</span>

- Bias
- Data exclusion
- Difficulties in selecting the sample

<span style="color:#00b050">Approaches to Probability sampling</span>

- Simple random sampling - equal probability
	- Selecting a ball from urn.
- Systematic sampling - select the members at regular intervals from a sequentially arranged lot. k = N/n, N = population size, n = sample size, k = sampling interval
- Stratified random sampling - strata is homogenous (i.e., mutually exclusive) sub group. Sample randomly from each stratum.
	- Stratified sampling in a shopping male and ensuring a characteristic such as male.
- Cluster sampling - Divide the population into heterogenous clusters. Then randomly select the entire cluster or samples from the clusters.
	- If a researcher wishes to poll a sample of shoppers at a shopping mall. Then create cluster of stores and interview the customers from them.

Approaches to Non-Probability sampling

- Convenience - researcher selects the sample.
- Voluntary response
- Snowball - creating a chain of referrals
- Judgemental -
